2. Changed/exchanged features? 
    We decided to change the calendar into multiple tables that list the users interview schedule and application. 
    Calendar template library made it difficult for the user to see all available applications, was too heavy of an 
    implementation, some parts of the library was incompatible with other parts of our project. The table was lighter 
    and was able to list all open application to the users without scrolling through the calendar.
